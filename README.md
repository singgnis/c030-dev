# THIS REPO IS NO LONGER IN USE
All libraries for the C030 platform are now available from https://developer.mbed.org/teams/ublox/code/.

# C030 Development Area

This repo contains the early development code and associated tests for the C030 board.  This code will later be split into individual libraries.

# Prerequisites

To fetch and build the code in this repository you must first install the [mbed CLI tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installation) and their prerequisites; this will include a compiler (you can use GCC_ARM, ARM or IAR).  You will need to use `mbed config` to tell the mbed CLI tools where that compiler is.

Then, to run the tests, you must install the [mbed test tools](https://github.com/ARMmbed/greentea/blob/master/docs/QUICKSTART.md).

# How To Test This Code

Clone this repo.

Change directory to this repo and run:

`mbed update`

...to get the very latest mbed-os development branch that has been forked to u-blox Github.

Change to the `mbed-os` directory and run:

`mbed update c030-dev`

...to switch to the `c030-dev` branch that we are working on in our u-blox mbed-os Github repository.

Set the target and the toolchain that you want to use, which should be `UBLOX_C030_U201` and one of `GCC_ARM`, `ARM` or `IAR`.

You can set the target and toolchain for this application once by entering the following two commands (while in the top-level directory of the cloned repo):

`mbed target UBLOX_C030_U201`

`mbed toolchain GCC_ARM`

Now you are ready to run the tests.  Connect your board to your PC and check that it can be found by entering:

`mbedls`

You should get back something like:

```
+------------------+----------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------------------+-----------------+
| platform_name    | platform_name_unique | mount_point | serial_port | target_id                | daplink_version |
+------------------+----------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------------------+-----------------+
| UBLOX_C030_U201  | UBLOX_C030_U201[0]   | D:          | COM1        | 12340201E3953CC69934E380 | 0201            |
+------------------+----------------------+-------------+-------------+--------------------------+-----------------+
```

If you get back the platform NZ32_SC151 (target_id commencing 6660), or some other target while we are still not quite setup with the correct board IDs, then you will need to get mbed to pretend it is a C030 board.  You can do this with a command of the following form:

`mbedls --mock 6660:UBLOX_C030_U201`

Now you can build and run the tests for all of mbed with the following command line:

`mbed test`

Or if you want to test just the drivers in the directory, use the following command line:

`mbed test -n driver*`

You should see output something like:

# Low Power Modes

The ability to enter and leave low power modes can be influenced by the debug chip on the mbed board.  It may not be possible to run test of low power mode using `mbed test` as usual, as the process of downloading to the board causes the debug chip to put the target MCU into the wrong state.  A way around this is to download the build, power off the board entirely, power it up again and then run the tests without the download step, using:

`mbedhtrun --skip-flashing -p COMx:9600`

...where `x` is replaced by the number of the COM port where the board is attached.

# What To Do If You Are Not Interested In Tests

As well as the tests for the code in here, there is a `main.cpp` file which is usually not used as it gets in the way of compilation of the tests.  If you wish to use it, edit it and change the `#if 0` to be `#if 1`.  Then you can compile it with:

`mbed compile`

You will find the output files in the sub-directory `BUILD/UBLOX_C030_U201/GCC_ARM/`.  Drag and drop the `.bin` file onto the mbed mapped drive presented by the C030 board and wait for it to program.  Then connect a serial terminal (e.g. PuTTY or TeraTerm) to the mbed COM port (@ 9600/8/N/1) presented by the C030 board.  Press the reset button on the board and you should see serial output. It doesn't do a great deal, that's what the tests are for.

# Debugging

In order to run a debugger on the target, which is best done under Eclipse, you should follow the instructions [here](http://erika.tuxfamily.org/wiki/index.php?title=Tutorial:_STM32_-_Integrated_Debugging_in_Eclipse_using_GNU_toolchain).

This will involve installing [Eclipse (Mars)](https://eclipse.org/mars/) plus the GDB hardware plugin, the [ST-Link utility](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stsw-link004.html), and a GDB server (the page suggests [Texane](https://github.com/texane/stlink).  There are Eclipse projects files in this repo, import them into Eclipse; configure the Eclipse debug launch options as the above web page directs, launch the Texane GDB server (the website says to launch the ST-Link utility also but that doesn't appear to be necessary, the Texane GDB server does everything), compile the target with debug information included (see below) and you should be able to see what's going on with source level debug.

Note: I find that the Texane GDB server crashes when you close a debug session.   If, when starting a debug session, Eclipse reports the somewhat strange error:

```
Error in final launch sequence
Failed to execute MI command:
-target-select remote localhost:4242

Error message from debugger back end:
localhost:4242: The system tried to join a drive to a directory on a joined drive.
```

...then it probably means the Texane GDB server is not running.

By default mbed builds with maximum optimisation and no debug information, i.e. a release build.  To build in such a way that source level single stepping is available, do a clean build with the following switch added to your compilation command line:

`--profile mbed-os/tools/profiles/debug.json`

...so for instance:

`mbed compile -c --profile mbed-os/tools/profiles/debug.json`

To run just that test, go and find the built binary (down in `BUILD/tests/...`) and drag/drop it onto the mbed mapped drive presented by the board.  To  run the test under a debugger, run `mbedls` as above to determine the COM port that your board is connected to.  Supposing it is `COM1`, you would then start the target board under your debugger and, on the PC side, enter the following to begin the test:

`mbedhtrun --skip-flashing --skip-reset -p COM1:9600`
